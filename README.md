# Person Class with User Input Program
This Python script defines a Person class that allows you to create instances of a person by taking user input for the name, age, and gender. It then introduces the person using the provided information.

## How It Works
Class Definition:
1. The script defines a class named Person, which contains:

- A constructor function __init__(self, name, age, gender) to initialize the object's attributes (name, age, gender) when an object is created.
- A method introduce(self) that prints a personalized greeting message including the person's name, age, and gender.
2. User Input:
The program prompts the user to input:

- Their name (name)
- Their age (age)
- Their gender (gender)
3. Object Creation:
After retrieving the user's input, an object named Citizen is created from the Person class, passing in the name, age, and gender provided by the user.
4. Method Call:
The introduce() method is called on the Citizen object, which prints a personalized introduction message to the console.
